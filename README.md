# WordPress-Archive-Page-Menu-Extension
WordPress plugin used to extend the default menu builder UI. Provides a new section that lets you link directly to archive pages for custom post types. Will display a link to the post type archive for quick use.

##How it works
When activated this plugin searches for all public content types that have their archive enabled. If there are archives enabled they will appear as links that can be added to you menu easily. When added they use the same interface as 'custom' links so you can change the title / customise the URL as needed

##Where this is useful
If your site has several custom content types defines this will give you an easy way to link directly to them without having to put in a custom URL (which might change if you migrate your site). E.g you could link to your custom `projects` content type archive page directly without having to worry about the URL. 

###Default Content Types
WordPress's defualt content types such as `posts`, `pages`, `media` etc don't have an archive page defined by default so this plugin won't link to them.
